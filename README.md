# Brick

Brick is a component library bases on `Phoenix.View` and `Phoenix.Template`. 

It's meant to be more strict in what it does no cater more to a component based
workflow then `phoenix` does and also enable a few things, to not only allow 
components to be used to render data, but also create styleguides for them.
